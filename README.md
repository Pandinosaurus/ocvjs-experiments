# ocvjs-experiments
This repository demonstrates serverless, client-side, computer vision experiments with opencvjs (and webgl in the future).
Please, consider this repository as a complement to the official (but somewhat quite basic) opencvjs exemples.


### Available experiments
Each experiment has its own opencv folder with opencv.js (wasm) and utils.js. All experiments should work on Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android and Linux with a HTML5 & WASM compatible browser.
